# The Problem
One day I was using [rclone](https://rclone.org) to sync my files and I realized it would be nice to have inclusion-exclusion features similar to that of [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) files, which is [currently not implemented](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/671) (as of 2020.11.29).

# Useful Tools
[go-gitignore](https://godoc.org/github.com/sabhiram/go-gitignore)
[npm-ignore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignore)
[npm-ignore-walk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignore-walk)
